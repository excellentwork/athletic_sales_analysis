# Atheletic Sales Analysis


You'll use sales data to gain information of the cities in the U.S. have sold the most athletic gear over a period of two years (2020-2021). Then you'll determine which retailers had the greatest total sales for athletic wear and which retailers sold the most women's athletic footwear. Finally, you'll determine which day and week had the highest sales for women's athletic footwear.
